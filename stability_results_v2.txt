=== Stability Feedback Engine Integration Test ===

[StateAggregationEngine] Provider registered: TestingRiskProvider
[StateAggregationEngine] Engine started. Update interval: 500ms

[Simulating] Rapidly rising risk (Scenario: Weak Intervention)
[RiskEscalationModule] TIER CHANGE: STABLE -> ELEVATED
[RiskEscalationModule] Rationale: ELEVATED: Preemptive risk mitigation active. Authority limits tightened.
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Analyzing intervention: STABLE -> ELEVATED
[Simulating] Risk continues to grow despite escalation...
[RiskEscalationModule] TIER CHANGE: ELEVATED -> HIGH
[RiskEscalationModule] Rationale: HIGH: Significant system stress detected. Multi-agent confirmation activated.
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Analyzing intervention: ELEVATED -> HIGH
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Intervention Result: ESCALATION
 > Success Score: 77.5%
 > Risk Control: 0.44
 > Volatility Score: 1.00

[STABILITY REPORT] Intervention ID: inv_1771940133758
 > Result: SUCCESS
 > Score: 77.5%
 > Risk Propagation Control: 0.44
 > Current ELEVATED Risk Threshold: 1500
 > ELEVATED Auth Multiplier: 0.750

[Simulating] Risk dropping due to tightened rules...
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Intervention Result: ESCALATION
 > Success Score: 100.0%
 > Risk Control: 1.00
 > Volatility Score: 1.00
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] High effectiveness. Relaxing constraints for efficiency.
[RiskEscalationModule] Tier definition updated for HIGH

 > Result: SUCCESS
 > Score: 100.0%
 > Risk Propagation Control: 1.00
 > Current ELEVATED Risk Threshold: 1500
 > ELEVATED Auth Multiplier: 0.750
[RiskEscalationModule] TIER CHANGE: HIGH -> STABLE
[RiskEscalationModule] Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Analyzing intervention: HIGH -> STABLE
[StabilityFeedbackEngine] Intervention Result: DE-ESCALATION
 > Success Score: 100.0%
 > Risk Control: 1.00
 > Volatility Score: 1.00
