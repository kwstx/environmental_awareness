[SCENARIO 1] Simulating Rapid Treasury Depletion (Leading to instability)...
 > Snapshot 1: Treasury: 9,150,000
[Behavior - T+600ms] Freq Multiplier: 1.000, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
 > Snapshot 2: Treasury: 8,300,000
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 12.1%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[Behavior - T+1200ms] Freq Multiplier: 1.000, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
 > Snapshot 3: Treasury: 7,450,000
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 15.7%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[Behavior - T+1800ms] Freq Multiplier: 1.000, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
 > Snapshot 4: Treasury: 6,600,000
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 18.6%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[Behavior - T+2400ms] Freq Multiplier: 1.000, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
 > Snapshot 5: Treasury: 5,750,000
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 20.9%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[Behavior - T+3000ms] Freq Multiplier: 1.000, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: System is operating within normal parameters.
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 22.7%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 24.1%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 25.3%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 26.3%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion

[SCENARIO 2] Simulating Task Density Spike & Performance Degradation...
 > Density jumped to 300, Efficiency dropped to 40%
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 37.0%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 45.6%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[Behavior - Surge Active] Freq Multiplier: 0.630, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: FORECAST: Proactive throttling due to rising 37% stress signal.
[RiskEscalationModule] TIER CHANGE: STABLE -> ELEVATED
[RiskEscalationModule] Rationale: ELEVATED: Forecasted instability markers. Proactive authority tightening.

[EVENT] Tier Escalation: STABLE -> ELEVATED
 > Rationale: ELEVATED: Forecasted instability markers. Proactive authority tightening.
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 52.3%
 -> Warning: Rapid treasury depletion
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 55.4%
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 55.6%
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 55.9%
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 56.0%
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[StressForecastingEngine] Forecast updated: 56.1%
 -> Warning: Task density spike
[Behavior - Post-Surge] Freq Multiplier: 0.440, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: ENHANCED: Frequency scaled back due to system stress. FORECAST: Proactive throttling due to rising 56% stress signal.

--- Test Simulation Complete ---
Final Forecasted Stress: 56.0%
[Behavior - Final] Freq Multiplier: 0.440, Mode: balanced
 > Rationale: ENHANCED: Frequency scaled back due to system stress. FORECAST: Proactive throttling due to rising 56% stress signal.
